Firstly, make sure you have installed PHP 7.1 or a higher version and the Composer package manager to create a new Symfony application.
 After that, create a new project by executing the following command in the terminal

composer create-project symfony/skeleton rest_api_project


install some necessary bundles with composer 

composer require friendsofsymfony/rest-bundle
composer require sensio/framework-extra-bundle
composer require jms/serializer-bundle
composer require symfony/validator
composer require symfony/form
composer require symfony/orm-pack
